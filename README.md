# PicoCTF2023-Writeup

This is my first CTF event that I had participated. It certainly has encouraged and motivated me to learn more about ethical hacking and CTF. I had a lot of fun solving the challenges and I hope to participate in more CTF events in the future.

These are the challenges that I had explored and solved. I will be updating this repository as I solve more challenges.
